# BigFoot-Ship-Wrecks-with-AI-Boat-Guards
The whole reason I started This was because I wanted to use the HAFM Ships mod to have battleships ect guard these loot crates so players could purchase ships at trader and go to battle on the sea. After many hours of testing of course Arma has to be like hell no you got a good idea going we are going to fuck your plans up. Every CUP ship and HAFM Ship has this error when tying to use them "Duplicate HitPoint name 'HitTurret'" not sure what causes this but think its something only mod developer can fix, I have no idea but when this happens it messes up the whole AI  part of the script. There were only 2 small boats from the CUP mod that actually worked but I wanted ships not boats. Anyway enough crying, here is a copy of Bigfoot Ship Wrecks with AI boats guarding loot positions.
